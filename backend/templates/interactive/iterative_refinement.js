ITERATIVE DISCOVERY PROCESS: "${query}"

PROGRESSIVE CONSULTATION METHODOLOGY:
My approach leverages my expertise in ${roleInfo.specialties.join(", ")} to quickly identify the core variables while maintaining flexibility to dive deeper where needed. We'll start with fundamental understanding and iteratively refine based on what we learn.

CORE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:

üîç INITIAL EXPLORATION ROUND

QUESTION 1: OBJECTIVE & CONTEXT MAPPING
"What specific outcome are you seeking, and what's the broader context this fits into? Help me understand both your immediate goal and how this connects to your larger objectives or responsibilities."

This reveals: Primary objectives, strategic context, success criteria, and stakeholder considerations.

QUESTION 2: CAPABILITY & RESOURCE ASSESSMENT
"What relevant experience, skills, or resources do you currently have, and what feels like the biggest gap or challenge? Include any previous attempts, available time/budget, and team support."

This uncovers: Starting point, available assets, key constraints, and primary obstacles.

QUESTION 3: APPROACH PREFERENCES & CONSTRAINTS
"How do you prefer to tackle complex challenges, and are there any specific constraints or requirements I should consider? Think about learning style, risk tolerance, timeline pressures, and organizational factors."

This determines: Optimal methodology, delivery approach, risk considerations, and environmental factors.

üéØ FOCUSED REFINEMENT ROUND

QUESTION 4: SUCCESS PATTERNS & MOTIVATION DRIVERS
"Reflecting on past challenges you've successfully navigated, what approaches and conditions have worked best for you? What typically keeps you motivated and engaged when facing obstacles?"

This identifies: Proven success strategies, motivation factors, resilience patterns, and optimal working conditions.

QUESTION 5: STAKEHOLDER DYNAMICS & COLLABORATION NEEDS
"Who else will be involved in or affected by this work, and how do you typically prefer to collaborate or get support? Consider team members, managers, customers, or others whose success matters to the outcome."

This clarifies: Collaboration requirements, communication needs, stakeholder management, and support system optimization.

QUESTION 6: SCALING & EVOLUTION CONSIDERATIONS
"Beyond solving the immediate challenge, how do you envision these capabilities evolving? Are you looking for a one-time solution, or is this part of building longer-term expertise and capabilities?"

This reveals: Future vision, scaling requirements, knowledge transfer needs, and strategic investment priorities.
