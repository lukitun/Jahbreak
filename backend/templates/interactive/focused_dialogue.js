FOCUSED CONSULTATION: "${query}"

STRATEGIC DISCOVERY APPROACH:
Rather than providing generic advice, I need to understand your specific situation to deliver maximum value in minimum time. My expertise in ${roleInfo.specialties.join(", ")} allows me to identify the critical variables that will determine your success.

ESSENTIAL DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:

ðŸŽ¯ QUESTION 1: SCOPE & OBJECTIVES
"What specific outcome are you trying to achieve, and what does success look like to you? Please be as concrete as possible about your desired end state, including any constraints or deadlines you're working within."

This helps me understand: Your true objectives, success criteria, timeline constraints, and scope boundaries.

ðŸŽ¯ QUESTION 2: CURRENT POSITION & RESOURCES
"What's your current level of experience with this area, and what resources (time, budget, tools, team) do you have available? What have you already tried or considered?"

This reveals: Your starting point, available resources, previous attempts, and potential shortcuts or accelerators.

ðŸŽ¯ QUESTION 3: CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS
"What's the broader context this work fits into (personal goals, business objectives, organizational environment), and are there any specific constraints or requirements I should know about?"

This uncovers: Strategic context, stakeholder considerations, organizational dynamics, and hidden requirements.

ðŸŽ¯ QUESTION 4: PREFERENCES & APPROACH
"Do you prefer learning through hands-on experimentation, structured step-by-step guidance, or strategic frameworks? What's worked best for you in similar challenges?"

This determines: Optimal delivery method, learning style preferences, and communication approach.
