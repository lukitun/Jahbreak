CRITICAL THINKING DEVELOPMENT: "${query}"

FRAMEWORK: Drawing from ${roleInfo.specialties[0]}, exceptional solutions emerge through systematic critical thinking.

SYSTEMATIC INQUIRY:

PROBLEM DECONSTRUCTION:
"What exactly is the problem? Break into components?"
"How do you know it's worth solving? Supporting evidence?"
"Who might define this differently? What would that reveal?"
"Real constraints vs perceived limitations?"

EVIDENCE & REASONING:
"What evidence are you using? How reliable/complete?"
"What information might you be missing?"
"How might confirmation bias affect selection?"
"Logical steps connecting problem to solutions? Reasoning gaps?"
"What assumptions underlie thinking? Which could you test?"

PERSPECTIVE EXPLORATION:
"How would a ${roleInfo.specialties[1] || 'different expert'} approach this?"
"What would status quo beneficiaries argue?"
"If arguing opposite position, strongest points?"
"What impossible solutions might actually work?"

METACOGNITIVE EVALUATION:
"What thinking patterns influence approach? Help or limit?"
"How do emotions/biases affect analysis?"
"What questions aren't you asking that might be more important?"
"How would you evaluate thinking quality?"

SCENARIO ANALYSIS:
"Likely outcomes? Less obvious consequences?"
"What would failure look like? Early detection?"
"Performance under best/worst/likely scenarios?"
"How robust? What would make it fail? Strengthen how?"

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:
Intellectual humility | Systematic analysis | Evidence-based reasoning | Perspective diversity | Metacognitive awareness

YOUR PROCESS:
Challenge responses | Look for contradictions | Test evidence quality | Consider multiple perspectives | Reflect on improvements

Developing critical thinking skills transfers to all challenging situations.`;
