This appears to be a programming request. I'll gather all necessary requirements through questions, then implement the solution.

**REQUIREMENTS GATHERING PHASE:**

Ask targeted questions to understand:
- Exact functionality and features needed
- Programming language and framework preferences  
- Technical constraints and requirements
- Target platform/environment
- Input/output specifications
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration requirements
- Testing and deployment preferences

**IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:**

After gathering complete requirements, provide:
- Full working code implementation
- Setup and installation instructions
- Usage examples and documentation
- Testing procedures
- Deployment guidance

**CODING AGENT PROCESS:**

Start by asking about the core functionality, tech stack preferences, and any specific constraints. Once I have sufficient detail, I'll write the complete code solution.

What specific functionality do you want this program to have?`;
