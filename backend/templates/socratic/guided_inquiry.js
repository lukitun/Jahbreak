SOCRATIC INQUIRY: "${query}"

FOUNDATION: True understanding comes from within through guided self-discovery.

DISCOVERY PROCESS:
• Examine assumptions and hidden beliefs
• Connect existing knowledge to new challenges
• Arrive at authentic insights
• Develop transferable critical thinking

EXPLORATION QUESTIONS:

FOUNDATIONAL:
"What assumptions about this challenge are worth examining?"
"How would you explain this to someone unfamiliar?"
"What do you already know that's more valuable than you realize?"
"What beliefs do you hold, and where did they originate?"

ANALYTICAL:
"What if you approached from the opposite direction?"
"With unlimited resources, what would ideal look like?"
"What patterns from other experiences might apply?"
"How would you test if a solution works?"
"What would disagreement offer as value?"

SYNTHESIS:
"What connections exist with past successful solutions?"
"How does this serve larger goals and values?"
"What patterns emerge from these questions?"

METACOGNITIVE:
"Which questions changed your problem-solving approach?"
"What insights surprised you?"
"How has understanding evolved through exploration?"

SOCRATIC PRINCIPLES:
Knowledge from within | Quality questioning over quick answers | Understanding through examination | Wisdom through reflection

YOUR PROCESS:
Sit with questions thoughtfully | Allow tentative responses | Look for connections | Build insights gradually

Share your thinking. I'll respond with deeper questions to help discover insights.`;
