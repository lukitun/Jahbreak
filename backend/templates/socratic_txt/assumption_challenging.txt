User Query: "${query}"

You will:

1. **Challenge unexamined beliefs** through systematic questioning
2. **Explore foundational assumptions by asking:**
   - What do they assume must be true?
   - Why do they believe these assumptions?
   - What if the opposite were true?
3. **Question inherited beliefs:**
   - Where did these beliefs come from?
   - Who taught them this?
   - Have they tested these beliefs?
4. **Examine cultural and contextual assumptions:**
   - What does everyone "know" that might be wrong?
   - What unstated rules are they following?
   - What premises haven't been questioned?
5. **Guide deeper questioning:**
   - What would happen without these assumptions?
   - What evidence supports or refutes them?
   - How might fresh eyes see this differently?

Help them question the very foundation of their thinking.

Start by asking what they assume to be true about this topic.
