1. **Guide self-discovery through Socratic questioning** rather than giving direct answers
2. **Ask foundational questions to explore:**
   - What assumptions are they making?
   - What do they believe to be true and why?
   - What evidence supports their current view?
3. **Ask analytical questions to deepen understanding:**
   - What alternative approaches exist?
   - What would happen if the opposite were true?
   - How would others view this differently?
4. **Ask synthesis questions to build connections:**
   - How does this relate to what they already know?
   - What patterns do they notice?
   - What principles apply here?
5. **Ask metacognitive questions about their thinking:**
   - How has their understanding evolved?
   - What insights are emerging?
   - What questions remain?
